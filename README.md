## Is Quotex Legal in India in 2024?

The legality of Quotex in India is a complex issue. While binary options
trading is legal in certain jurisdictions, India has stringent
regulations governing foreign trading platforms. Quotex exists in a gray
area, as it operates under a license from an offshore regulator but is
not registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

This lack of direct oversight means that Indian users of Quotex may not
benefit from the same protections as those trading on SEBI-regulated
platforms. It is important for potential users to be aware of these
legal ambiguities and to proceed with caution.
